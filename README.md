##Objective:
Hospitals are daunting places patients of all ages, but especially for children. One way to make medical examinations less intimidating is to explain to patients what will happen. It can be very difficult to explain to small children what will happen though. The purpose of this project is to develop a game for small children (2-6 years old) that explains what will happen at an examination in the Nuclear Medicine Department of Chelsea & Westminster Hospital. It should be easy for the hospital to deploy the game and make it available to patients and their parents/guardians.

## Latest Minutes: 
<p><em>Discussion:</em></p>
<p>We looked at the progress that people made since the last meeting.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Note: do not edit existing controllers, create new ones and copy the functionality</strong></li>
<li>Consistency, for example with speech bubbles and font of text. We decided to have black writting, using ariel font and white speech bubble. Size font 20.</li>
<li>The injection mini-game is very good, we are just looking into the panda's speech bubble. - We need a slight delay on the timer before the game starts and the score shown on the end</li>
<li>The scanner scene, Hailey did a great job with the animation</li>
<li>The dodge-food mini game, the start and end screen need to be consistent with that of the injection mini game. We need to add the timer to the running scene.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>To do:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Try to get the little things finished for monday so that all scenes are as complete as they can be</li>
